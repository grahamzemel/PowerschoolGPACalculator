# PowerSchool GPA Calculator
"*Math math math math math math math math math math math math math...*" - John Wetzel, 2023

Created sometime in 2022, in development as of 11/11/2023.

## Functionality
This is the source code of a GPA calculator extension for PowerSchool. It is designed to be used by students to automatically calculate their Weighted and Unweighted GPA. 

Upon installation of the **Chrome Extension linked [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/powerschool-gpa-calculato/dgfnbmfhjioifionnlcklnpfkkjjglbj?hl=en-US&authuser=0)**, the student's PowerSchool interface will be modified to include their GPA information in additional rows above the gradebook on the main page. 

## Additional Features
The user can sort their classes by AP / Honors / Regular weight with the click of a button (the checkbox right below the yearly GPA calculations), and weigh their classes by difficulty with the checkboxes next to each class (marked AP and H for AP and Honors respectively).
